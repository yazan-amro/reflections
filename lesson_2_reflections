When you intializae it, you basically create a file within the system that git can follow and track your files. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the “index”, but it’s also common to refer to it as the staging area.
